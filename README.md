#CalcMAX
The pyCalculator is a feature-rich graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python and Tkinter. It supports basic, scientific, and graphing calculations, providing users with a comprehensive tool for mathematical operations. The calculator includes a modern UI design with simulated rounded corners for buttons and supports both light and dark themes.

##Features

###Basic Calculations
-Standard arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)
-Percentage calculation (%)
-Negation toggle (±)

###Scientific Calculations
-Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) and their inverses (asin, acos, atan)
-Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh)
-Logarithmic functions (log, ln)
-Exponential functions (e^x)
-Square root (√) and cube root (∛)
-Power functions (x^y)
-Constants (π, e)
-Absolute value (|x|)
-Factorial and modulus

###Graphing Capabilities
-Plot mathematical functions
-Zoom in and out of graphs (being fixed)
-Reset graph view (being fixed)
-Modern UI Design
-Light and dark themes with easy toggle
-Responsive layout that adapts to window resizing
-History display for the last 10 calculations
-Prerequisites
-Python 3.x
-Required Python libraries:
-tkinter (comes with Python standard library)
-matplotlib
-numpy
-sympy

###Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following commands:
```
pip install matplotlib numpy sympy
```
