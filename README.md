Advanced Calculator Application
Project Overview
The Advanced Calculator is a feature-rich graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python and Tkinter. It supports basic, scientific, and graphing calculations, providing users with a comprehensive tool for mathematical operations. The calculator includes a modern UI design with simulated rounded corners for buttons and supports both light and dark themes.

Features
Basic Calculations:

Standard arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷)
Percentage calculation (%)
Negation toggle (±)
Scientific Calculations:

Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) and their inverses (asin, acos, atan)
Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh)
Logarithmic functions (log, ln)
Exponential functions (e^x)
Square root (√) and cube root (∛)
Power functions (x^y)
Constants (π, e)
Absolute value (|x|)
Factorial and modulus

Graphing Capabilities:
Plot mathematical functions
Zoom in and out of graphs
Reset graph view
Modern UI Design:
Light and dark themes with easy toggle
Responsive layout that adapts to window resizing
History display for the last 10 calculations
